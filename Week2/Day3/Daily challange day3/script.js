// Ex 
// 1. Write a JavaScript program that recreates the pattern below.
// 2. Do this challenge twice: first by using one loop, then by using two nested for loops (Nested means one inside the other - check out this tutorial of nested loops).
// 3. Do this Daily Challenge by yourself, without looking at the answers on the internet.

let space = ' ';

for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++){
